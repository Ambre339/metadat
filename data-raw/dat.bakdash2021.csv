Low (attentional) demand is good SA. High demand is bad SA
KM - To me this looks like the number is right but the labels are wrong. Pulling from Figure 3, where 
UW4 = performance, the correlations should be SA 1 ~ UW4 = 0.2, SA2 ~ UW4 = 0.12, and SA3 ~ UW4 = 0.46. 
Only the correlation between SA3 and UW4 is significant.

Thought the authors refer to clinical performance as team performance, it's not actually a team. It's a participant

participant's performance is more or less independent of the confederate. Real-time probe is closest assessment method, it appears to be observer rated SA (in real-time)"
