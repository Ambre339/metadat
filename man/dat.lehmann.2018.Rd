\details{
This is data from a meta-analyses of studies that test the red-romance hypothesis, which is that the color red enhances heterosexual attraction in romantic contexts. Analyzing male participants only, the meta-analysis should show a small, statistically significant effect (d = 0.26 [0.12, 0.40], p = .0004, N = 2,961).  Analyzing female participants only should show a very small effect (d = 0.13 [0.01, 0.25], p = .03, N = 2,739).  The analyses in the published meta-analysis found clear evidence of upward bias in the estimate for female participants and equivocal evidence for male participants.  Moderator analyses suggest effect sizes may have declined over time (both genders), may be largest when an original shade of red is used (men only) and may be smaller in pre-registered studies (women only).
