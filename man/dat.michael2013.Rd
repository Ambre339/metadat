\details{
   Meta-analysis by Michael et al. (2013) of experiments on the persuasive power of a brain image.  The meta-analysis analyzed an original study by McCabe & Castel (2008) as well as 10 replication attempts conducted by the authors of the meta-analysis.  In each study, participants read an article about using brain imaging as a lie detector.  The article either included a superfluous fMRI image of a brain (brain) or not (no_brain).  After reading the article, all participants responded to the statement "Do you agree or disagree with the conclusion that brain imaging can be used as a lie detector?" on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).  The original study by McCabe & Castel (2008) reported a relatively large increase in agreement due to the prence of brain images.  Meta-analysis of the original study with the 10 replications suggests, however, a small, possibly null effect: estimated raw effect size of 0.07, 95\% CI [0.00, 0.14] under a random-effects model.  In some studies, the article included a passage critiquing the primary claims made in the article; this is coded in the 'Included_Critique' column for analysis as a possible moderator.  Note that Experiment 3 by McCabe & Castel was a 2x2 between subjects design: brain image presence was manipulated as well as the inclusion of a critique.  The two different critique conditions are recorded as separate rows in this data set.  Analysis of this data set with metafor yields the same results (given rounding) reported in the manuscript.
